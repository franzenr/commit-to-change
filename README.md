 "Commit to Change: How to Increase Accessibility in Your Favorite Open Source Projects", initially given at Posit::conf(2023) on 20 September 2023. 

Presented again at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia in celebration of National Disability Employment Awareness Month on 24 October 2023

![The design of a hexagon shaped sticker with a dark purple background, a purple to pink gradient border, and pale yellow text that says "commit to change". The word "commit" is stylized to bring to mind the concept of running a "git commit" command on a command line interface.](hex-sticker.png)

In order to get one of these lovely hex stickers, you need to `commit to change` by taking a first step to increase accessibility in an open source project. Tag me in the comments of a pull request or open issue!
